Super Mario Platforms is a 2D Scrolling Platformer in which Mario must jump from platform
to platform without falling, in order to reach the pipe at the end of the level which will
take Mario to fight his arch-nemesis, Bowser. When Mario reaches Bowser, the new challenge
is not to avoid falling but to jump on the giant turtle's head, thus defeating him. 
Once Mario does this, the player has won the game.
The user can make Mario move left and right by using the left and right arrow keys. The user
can make Mario jump by pressing the space bar. 
The second mode, boss mode, differs because the screen does not scroll and enemy-fighting is 
introduced.
