#   This file contains the list of actions and the corresponding
# locations of the actions in the Game Engine.
#   These specific actions occur during collisions and are thereby
# used by the Collision Table Screen Class.
#
#   Most actions have either no parameters, or one parameter 
# consisting of a double value.
#
#   The action "SwitchOutAction" takes in another sprite
# (note: NOT a sprite *tag*) and the Collision Table Screen allows
# the user to select a pre-made sprite (one that they must have
# already created using the Sprite Edit Screen).
