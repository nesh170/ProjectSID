Description:
Design a game authoring environment that allows game designers, people with no programming skills, to build arcade-style 2D video games of a specific genre, using a variety of visual tools and requiring minimal programming. These games should be saved in a format that allows them the be re-loaded by the program for additional editing or deployed, loaded into a different program to be played by a user. The game player might be located on the same machine as the editor or it might get access to the game files via the web.

At a high level, this program can easily be divided into the following four components:

* game authoring environment: program of visual tools for placing, specifying, editing, and combining general game elements together to make a particular game
* game engine: framework of general Java classes to support any kind of game within a specific game genre
* game player: program that loads the game data and uses the game engine to run a particular game
* game data: files, assets, preferences, and code that represent a particular game
